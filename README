                                     pong

pong is a boot sector game written in C99. The challenge was to fit a playable
game inside a 512-byte MBR (master boot record). The game is ultra-portable,
working on any IBM PC compatible architecture. Whilst the build tools used to
make the game having only been tested on Linux, the game itself (included as 
`bin`) is independent of any OS.
